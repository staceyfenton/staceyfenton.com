The design was last updated in 2011, it wasnâ€™t responsive and was running on an old version of Umbraco which content editors found to be restrictive, making it difficult to add new content.</p>\n<p>This project would see a complete overhaul of the design with a content first approach and a brand new CMS (Umbraco 7).</p>\n<p>I was the lead developer for the first phase of the project which launched in 2015. A second phase is planned for 2016 which will see further design updates to the site.</p>\n<h3>Technologies used</h3>\n<p>HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Grunt</p>\n<h3>When</h3>\n<p>2014-2015</p>\n<p><a class=\"button\" href=\"http://ry.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit site</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211204/ry-home.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of RY homepage on desktop\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211217/ry-case-study.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of a RY work page on desktop\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211159/ry-thinking.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of RY Thinking page on desktop\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211210/ry-event.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of RY events listing page on desktop\"></p>\n<div class=\"grid grid--work grid--322\">\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211152/ry-news.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of a RY news article page on mobile\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211147/ry-culture.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of RY culture page on mobile\"></p>\n</div>\n","title":"Radley Yeldar","date":"2015-01-04","thumbnail":"https://d1nd6ebc4fb67p.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05211609/thumb-ry.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
