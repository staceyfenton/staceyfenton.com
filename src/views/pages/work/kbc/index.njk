    <h2>KBC Bank</h2>
    <p>KBC is one of the major Belgian banks, focusing on private clients and small to medium sized enterprises.</p>

    <p>They wanted to improve the design and user experience of their website in order to better engage with their key audiences, as well as optimise the site for mobile.</p>      
    <p>Myself and another developer were responsible for building static front-end templates. Once this was completed we handed over the files to the back-end developers at KBC Bank who integrated them into a Drupal CMS.</p>      
    <h3>Technologies used</h3>
    <p>HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Grunt</p>

    <h3>When</h3>
    <p>2015</p>
