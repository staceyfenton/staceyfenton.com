    <h2>Mace</h2>
    <p>Mace is a global consultancy and construction firm headquartered in London. The Shard and the London Eye are just two of the major projects Mace have been involved with.</p>

    <p>There was a lack of clarity around Mace's position and what it stood for, which led to a repositioning of their brand and this was executed through the new website. The content was re-written to give more of a focus to the people behind Mace and was designed to look less like a "typical corporate website".</p>      
    <p>I was the lead front-end developer on this project. It was my first time building a website on a Sitecore CMS platform.</p>
