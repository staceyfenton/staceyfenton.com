    <h2>Compare the Market</h2>
    <p>I have been working with Compare the Market since 2017. They are one of the UK's most popular price comparison websites.</p>

    <p>My team is responsible for the website's marketing content, including the homepage and hundreds of product landing pages and content pages.
    Our goal is to deliver fast performance and a great user experience to encourage our users to continue on their journey to purchasing one of our products.</p>     
    
    <p>One of the main projects I have worked on is the migration from a legacy solution to a brand new code base, hosted in the cloud and developed with performance and accessibility at the forefront. I have worked to introduce tools to enforce coding standards including linting for CSS and JavaScript, and pa11y to ensure we are complying with AA accessibility rules.</p>
