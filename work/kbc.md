KBC is one of the major Belgian banks, focusing on private clients and small to medium sized enterprises.

They wanted to improve the design and user experience of their website in order to better engage with their key audiences, as well as optimise the site for mobile.

Myself and another developer were responsible for building static front-end templates. Once this was completed we handed over the files to the back-end developers at KBC Bank who integrated them into a Drupal CMS.
