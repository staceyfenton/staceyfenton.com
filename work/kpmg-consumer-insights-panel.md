The The KPMG/YouGov Consumer Insights Panel is a forum of thought leaders with extensive fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) experience. They come together to discuss, debate and challenge ideas and customer insights.

This one-page site profiles the people who make up the panel and makes publications and research available for download.

I was tasked with re-skinning the website in 2014, updating the CSS, images and some content to give the site a fresh new look.

### Technologies used
