I'm currently working for Vodafone UK. My team is responsibile for My Vodafone Online, where retail customers can login and manage their account.

We are currently in the process of migrating from the legacy customer portal created ten years ago, to a brand new code base hosted in the cloud and built using the latest technologies. We've completely overhauled the UX to improve the performance and accessibility for our customers.

### Technologies used
React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6), Webpack, Vite, Terraform

### When
2021-Present
