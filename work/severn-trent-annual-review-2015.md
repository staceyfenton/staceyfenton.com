Severn Trent plc is a UK water company that is traded on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

In 2015 we created an Online Annual Report for Severn Trent to accompany the printed Annual Report. It was a single page site providing a high level summary of the Annual Report and consistent in look and feel with the printed version.

I was the lead front-end developer on this project.
