Coca-Cola HBC are one of the worldâ€™s largest bottlers for The Coca-Cola Company. They wanted to unite the global website as well as 21 local country sites with a consistent look and feel, make content more user friendly and easier to find, and optimise the site for mobile.

As of April 2016 the global site has been launched with plans to roll out the new design to all markets by 2017.

I was responsible for the front-end build, working closely with the design and UX teams, as well as helping to integrate the HTML into an Umbraco CMS.

The website won Gold for "Best use of digital in the food & beverage sector" at the 2016 Digital Impact Awards.
