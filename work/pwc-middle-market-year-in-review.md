PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is a multinational professional services network headquartered in London.

In 2015 we produced the Middle Market annual review for PwC, a microsite which is only accessible to people within the PwC Network. The site features case studies, videos and downloadable content.

I was the lead front-end developer building the microsite.
