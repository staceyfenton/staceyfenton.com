Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company are one of the worldâ€™s largest bottlers for The Coca-Cola Company. For this project we created a new template to showcase the highlights from their 2016 Integrated Annual Report.

The turn-around time on this project was quite short but the client was very happy with the result. We won Gold for Best FTSE 100 Online Report at the 2017 Corporate & Financial Awards.
