Mace is a global consultancy and construction firm headquartered in London. The Shard and the London Eye are just two of the major projects Mace have been involved with.

There was a lack of clarity around Mace's position and what it stood for, which led to a repositioning of their brand and this was executed through the new website. The content was re-written to give more of a focus to the people behind Mace and was designed to look less like a "typical corporate website".

I was the lead front-end developer on this project. It was my first time building a website on a Sitecore CMS platform.

Since the launch of the new website, Mace have seen a 20% increase in unique visits, 25% increase in average time people are spending on the site, and 47% increase in return visitors. They have also seen a significant improvement in recruitment, with a 78% increase in careers page views.

This website was nominated for two of The Drum's B2B Brave Awards 2017 - Best Enterprise Website and Best Content-Driven Digital Experience.
