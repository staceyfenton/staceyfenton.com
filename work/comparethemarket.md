I have been working with Compare the Market since 2017. They are one of the UK's most popular price comparison websites.

My team is responsible for the website's marketing content, including the homepage and hundreds of product landing pages and content pages. Our goal is to deliver fast performance and a great user experience to encourage our users to continue on their journey to purchasing one of our products.

One of the main projects I have worked on is the migration from a legacy solution to a brand new code base, hosted in the cloud and developed with performance and accessibility at the forefront. I have worked to introduce tools to enforce coding standards including linting for CSS and JavaScript, and pa11y to ensure we are complying with AA accessibility rules.

### Technologies used
HTML5, SASS, JavaScript (ES6), AMP, C#, Webpack, Terraform, React

### When
2017-present
