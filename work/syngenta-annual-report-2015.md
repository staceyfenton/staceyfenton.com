Syngenta is a global agriculture business that helps farmers make better use of their available resources, primarily through agrochemical and seed production.

They wanted to create an online annual report with it's own identity, separate from the printed version. It provides a high level summary of the Annual Review with the aim of making the site more engaging. They used analytics from the 2014 site to prioritise information and content.

I worked alongside another front-end developer to build the website.
