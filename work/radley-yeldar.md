The RY website was in need of a refresh. The design was last updated in 2011, it wasnâ€™t responsive and was running on an old version of Umbraco which content editors found to be restrictive, making it difficult to add new content.

This project would see a complete overhaul of the design with a content first approach and a brand new CMS (Umbraco 7).

I was the lead developer for the first phase of the project which launched in 2015. A second phase is planned for 2016 which will see further design updates to the site.

### Technologies used
HTML5, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, Grunt

### When
